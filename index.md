## Questions
**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic for me was learning how to use Chronos and TTM when working with time series data to create more accurate prediction models.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
One potential investigation I would like to pursue is creating an ML model that integrates both sentiment analysis and fundamental metrics to predict which stocks to invest in and outperform a predefined baseline.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
One potential change I’d make to the approach taken in my current Quarter 1 Project would be to expand my simulations to include stocks from various sectors, rather than focusing solely on one sector used in the initial data.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
Some other techniques I would be interested in incorporating into the project include technical indicator analysis, which could provide an additional dimension to enhance our overall analysis.
